# Pokedex

This was the first exercise in php.  
First we made a pokedex in JavaScript. To show us how "easy" it is to learn a new programming language
we had the exercise to make the pokedex work in php.
Everything works except for the evolutions and the 4 arrows. 
Use the input. Write a number or write a pokemon's name.

I know, there is still some stuff i need to figure out :)
